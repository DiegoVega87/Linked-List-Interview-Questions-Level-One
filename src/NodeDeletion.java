    * Your startup has built a linked list to store important client and financial data. However, sometimes you may
    * need to delete a node in this list due to data being outdated or irrelevant. Write a function that given
    * a node in the list and the list head, deletes that node in an efficient manner and returns the updated list.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   node = 3 -> 4 -> 5
    *   head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    *   Output = head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   node = 2 -> 3 -> 4
    *   node = 2 -> 3 -> 4
    *   Output = 1 ->3-> 4 -> 5
