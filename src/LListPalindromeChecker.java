    * A fintech startup has a website where users can create accounts and enter their personal information.
    * The company wants to ensure that their platform is secure by implementing a function that checks
    * if a user's personal information stored in a singly linked list is a palindrome. Write a function that
    * takes the head of the singly linked list and returns true if the linked list is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
    *   Output: true
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    *   Output: false
