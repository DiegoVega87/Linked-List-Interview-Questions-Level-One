    * Our startup has a workflow management system that involves a series of linked tasks.
    * We suspect that some of these workflows have cycles, which can cause serious operational issues.
    * We need you to write a function that takes in the head of a workflow and determines whether, or not
    * a cycle exists within it. Your function should return a boolean value indicating the presence or absence
    * of the cycle. A cycle is present if there is some node in the list that can be revisited by traversing
    * the next pointer.
