    /*
    * Our startup has a feature that allows users to create and manipulate linked lists. We have noticed that some
    * users are having trouble reversing their linked lists. We want you to implement a function that takes the head
    * of a singly linked list and reverses the list, returning the reversed list. The function should take the head
    * node as input and should be able to handle empty lists.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
    *   Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   Input: NULL
    *   Input: NULL
    * */
